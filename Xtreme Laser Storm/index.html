                    <h3>How to Play Laser Tag</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>The arena is divided into two sides, one each for the Red and Green teams. The typical play
                        experience lasts 20 minutes, including a briefing on rules and strategy, a stop in the ready
                        room to pick up a vest & phaser, and 10-12 minutes of intense competition in the arena.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Points are scored for your team by 'tagging' members of the opposing team or by 'tagging' their
                        base (aka "pod"). Once you've been 'tagged' there are four energizers (two for each team)
                        available to re-energize your phaser. Each player can re-energize an unlimited number of times
                        during each game to stay in the action. Players can keep track of each team's progress using the
                        scorecards located inside the arena.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Once time is up you return to the ready room to drop-off your vest & phaser. Head out to the lobby
                        to collect your score sheet to see how you did!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>When you come visit, please ask for a personal briefing to further explain how to play!</p>
                    <br>
